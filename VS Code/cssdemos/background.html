    <p>It outlines a number of objectives in the organizational Statutes, 
        including growing association football internationally, providing efforts to ensure it is accessible to everyone, 
        and advocating for integrity and fair play.[4] It is responsible for the organization and promotion of 
        association football's 
        major international tournaments, notably the World Cup which commenced in 1930 and the Women's World
         Cup which commenced in 1991. Although FIFA does not solely set the laws of the game, that being the
          responsibility of the International Football Association Board of which FIFA is a member, it applies
           and enforces the rules across all FIFA competitions.[5] All FIFA tournaments generate revenue from s
           ponsorship; in 2018, FIFA had revenues of over US $4.6 billion, ending the 2015–2018 cycle with a net 
           positive of US$1.2 billion, and had cash reserves of over US$2.7 billion.[6]

        Reports by investigative journalists have linked FIFA leadership with corruption, bribery, and vote-rigging
         related to the election of FIFA president Sepp Blatter and the organization's decision to award the 2018 and 
         2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar, respectively. These allegations led to the indictments of nine high-ranking 
         FIFA officials and five corporate executives by the U.S. Department of Justice on charges including racketeering,
          wire fraud, and money laundering. On 27 May 2015, several of these officials were arrested by Swiss authorities,
         who were launching a simultaneous but separate criminal investigation into how the organization awarded the 2018 and 
         2022 World Cups. 
        Those among these officials who were also indicted in the U.S. are expected to be extradited to face charges there as well.
        [7][8][9] 
        Many officials were suspended by FIFA's ethics committee including Sepp Blatter[10] and Michel Platini.
        [11] In early 2017, reports became public about FIFA president Gianni 
        Infantino attempting to prevent the re-elections[12] of both chairmen of the ethics committee, 
        Cornel Borbély and Hans-Joachim Eckert, during the FIFA congress in May 2017.
        [13][14] On 9 May 2017, following Infantino's proposal,[15] FIFA Council decided not to renew
         the mandates of Borbély and Eckert.
        [15] Together with the chairmen, 11 of 13 committee members were removed.
        FIFA is headquartered in Zürich, and is an association established under the law of Switzerland.

FIFA's supreme body is the FIFA Congress, an assembly made up of representatives from each affiliated member association. Each national football association has one vote, regardless of its size or footballing strength. The Congress assembles in ordinary sessions once every year, and extraordinary sessions have been held once a year since 1998. Congress makes decisions relating to FIFA's governing statutes and their method of implementation and application. Only Congress can pass changes to FIFA's statutes. The congress approves the annual report, and decides on the acceptance of new national associations, and holds elections. Congress elects the President of FIFA, its general secretary, and the other members of the FIFA Council in the year following the FIFA World Cup.[27]

FIFA Council – formerly called the FIFA Executive Committee and chaired by the president – is the main decision-making body of the organization in the intervals of congress. The council is composed of 37 people: the president; 8 vice presidents; and 28 members from the confederations, with at least one of them being a woman. The executive committee is the body that decides which country will host the World Cup.

The president and the general secretary are the main office holders of FIFA, and are in charge of its daily administration, carried out by the general secretariat, with its staff of approximately 280 members. Gianni Infantino is the current president, elected on 26 February 2016 at an extraordinary FIFA Congress session after former president Sepp Blatter was suspended pending a corruption investigation.[28][29]

FIFA's worldwide organizational structure also consists of several other bodies, under the authority of the FIFA Council or created by Congress as standing committees. Among those bodies are the FIFA Emergency Committee, the FIFA Ethics Committee, the Finance Committee, the Disciplinary Committee, and the Referees Committee.

The FIFA Emergency Committee deals with all matters requiring immediate settlement in the time frame between the regular meetings of the FIFA Council.[30][31] The Emergency Committee consists of the FIFA president as well as one member from each confederation.[32] Emergency Committee decisions made are immediately put into legal effect, although they need to be ratified at the next Executive Committee meeting.[33]
